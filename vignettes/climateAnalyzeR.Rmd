The primary function of this package is to produce brief climate reports using temperature and precipitation data from National Park Service Co-op stations using RMarkdown (*.Rmd). 
Currently a water year (Oct-Sep) and annual (Jan-Dec) reports have been developed and need to be tested more thoroughly. 
This package also imports vectorized data from [ClimateAnalyzer.org](http://climateanalyzer.org/) into R. 
Currently  annual, monthly, and daily weather data and water balance models for Co-op stations are available.

# Import data into R

```{r setup}
library(climateAnalyzeR)
```
