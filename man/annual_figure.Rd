\usage{
annual_figure(
  x_var,
  y_var,
  my_year,
  normal,
  reference_period,
  area_color,
  line_color,
  my_title,
  my_ylab
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_var}{A character string of the x-variable. This is intended to be a
vector of years.}

\item{y_var}{A character string of the y-variable. This is intended to be a
vector of measurements (e.g., PRCP or TEMP).}

\item{my_year}{A number for the your of interest.}

\item{normal}{A number for the annual normal temperature or precipitation.
Typically from \code{\link{normals}}.}

\item{reference_period}{Character string for the reference period used for
normals (e.g., "1981-2010").}

\item{area_color}{A character string for the color of the area. See
\code{\link[grDevices::colors]{name}} for a list of color names.}

\item{line_color}{A character string for the line color.}

\item{my_title}{A character string for the title.}

\item{my_ylab}{A character string from the y-axis.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
This function produces a standardized line graph with colored area under the
line and a trend line. This figure is used for annual measurements (e.g.,
precipitation or temperature) in RMarkdown scrips to produce reports.
